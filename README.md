3.  **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed. Then:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set Up API Keys**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory for API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, **LangSmith**):
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_langsmith_api_key" # For LangSmith
    LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
    LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="AdvancedAgenticAI" # Example project name for LangSmith
    ```
    **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control! Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

5.  **Explore Lessons**: Start with `Lessons/Chapter01`.
