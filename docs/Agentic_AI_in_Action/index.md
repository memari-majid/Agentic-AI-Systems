## Learning Path

This track is designed for hands-on learning. Start with **Chapter 1** for an overview, then work through each chapter sequentially. Each chapter includes practical examples and code implementations.

## Prerequisites

- Programming experience (Python recommended)
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with APIs and web services
- Completion of AI Systems track (recommended but not required)

## Tools You'll Use

- **LangChain**: Agent foundation framework
- **LangGraph**: State management and orchestration
- **DSPy**: Prompt optimization and evaluation
- **LangSmith**: Debugging and monitoring
- **Python**: Primary development language
