# Introduction to Agentic AI Systems

![Banner](./image.png)

Welcome to the course on Agentic AI Systems! This site provides a structured, interactive guide to the theory and practice of building advanced agentic AI, including lessons, labs, and supplementary materials.

## Course Overview

This course provides a rigorous exploration of the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of advanced agentic AI systems. It emphasizes core design principles, system orchestration, and the deployment of intelligent agents using contemporary software frameworks and methodologies.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into three complementary tracks:

### [AI Systems](AI_Systems/1.md)
The foundational theory track covers the conceptual underpinnings of agentic systems. You'll learn about generative AI fundamentals, agent architectures, essential components, reflection mechanisms, tool use, coordination approaches, design techniques, and ethical considerations.

### [Agent Development](Agentic_AI_in_Action/1.md)
The practical implementation track focuses on hands-on development of agentic systems. This track provides a step-by-step guide to building agents using modern frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph, optimizing with DSPy, managing state, and debugging with LangSmith.

### [AI Strategies](AI_Strategies/1.md)
The strategic application track explores organizational perspectives on AI adoption. Topics include the role of Chief AI Officers, building AI teams, crafting AI strategies, managing AI projects, and ensuring successful implementation across different business contexts.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, learners will be equipped to:
- Articulate the fundamental principles and cognitive architectures underpinning agentic artificial intelligence.
- Design and implement robust, sophisticated agent systems capable of complex reasoning, planning, and action execution.
- Develop and apply methodologies for orchestrating multi-step agentic behaviors and managing stateful interactions effectively.
- Integrate diverse external capabilities, including knowledge bases and specialized computational tools, within agentic frameworks.
- Critically analyze, construct, and evaluate agentic AI systems for real-world applications, considering ethical and performance implications.
- Develop organizational strategies for successful AI implementation and management.

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with the [AI Systems](AI_Systems/1.md) track to build a strong theoretical foundation, then moving to the [Agent Development](Agentic_AI_in_Action/1.md) track to apply those concepts in practice. The [AI Strategies](AI_Strategies/1.md) track can be studied in parallel for those interested in organizational and management aspects of AI.
