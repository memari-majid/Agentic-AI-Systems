## Contents

- [LangChain Tutorial](LangChain_Tutorial.md): A comprehensive guide to using LangChain for building agentic AI systems.
- [LangGraph Tutorial](LangGraph_Tutorial.md): A detailed guide to using LangGraph for orchestrating complex agent workflows with state management.

## Purpose

These appendix materials provide additional references, tutorials, and resources that complement the main content of the book but aren't essential to the core learning path. They're designed to help readers deepen their understanding of specific technologies and frameworks used in agentic AI development.

## How to Use

Each file in this directory can be read independently as a reference when you encounter related topics in the main book. They serve as extended resources for readers who want to explore particular subjects in more detail.
