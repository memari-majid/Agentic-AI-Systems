## Learning Path

Start with **Chapter 1** to build foundational knowledge of generative AI, then progress through each chapter sequentially. Each chapter builds upon concepts from previous chapters while introducing new theoretical frameworks and design principles.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with artificial intelligence fundamentals
- Programming experience (helpful but not required for theoretical understanding)
