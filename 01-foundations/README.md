## Learning Path

**Recommended Order:** Sequential (Chapters 01 → 11)

Each chapter builds upon concepts from previous chapters while introducing new theoretical frameworks and design principles.

## Next Steps

After completing the Foundations section:

1. **Apply Concepts**: Move to [Implementation](../02-implementation/) for hands-on practice
2. **Explore Modern Tools**: Check [Modern Frameworks](../03-modern-frameworks/) for latest technologies
3. **Practice**: Try [Labs](../06-labs/) to reinforce learning
4. **Strategic View**: Review [Strategy](../04-strategy/) for organizational context
