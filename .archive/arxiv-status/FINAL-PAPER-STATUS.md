## 📝 Writing Style Improvements

### Sentence Structure
**Before**: Simple, short sentences in bullet lists
```
- RAG provides currency
- It offers transparency  
- It handles large knowledge bases
```

**After**: Complex, flowing academic prose
```
Retrieval-augmented generation offers several compelling advantages for 
knowledge integration in agentic systems, ensuring currency by immediately 
reflecting updated information without requiring model retraining, making it 
ideal for domains where knowledge evolves rapidly, while transparency is 
enhanced through explicit source attribution and citations that enable users 
to verify claims and understand the provenance of agent responses, and the 
approach demonstrates excellent scalability in handling large knowledge bases 
efficiently through optimized vector search and retrieval mechanisms.
```

### Paragraph Development
✅ Each paragraph develops a single coherent idea
✅ Topic sentences introduce main concepts
✅ Supporting sentences elaborate with detail
✅ Concluding sentences synthesize or transition
✅ Smooth flow between paragraphs

### Academic Conventions
✅ Appropriate hedging ("suggests", "tends to", "can exhibit")
✅ Precise technical terminology
✅ Third-person perspective maintained
✅ Formal register throughout
✅ Proper citation integration
