### Summary Documents
- **PAPERS_SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive summary of key findings from all 5 papers with cross-paper themes
- **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed guide for integrating extracted information into the review paper (paper.tex)
- **README.md** - This file

## Conversion Process

The PDFs were converted to markdown format using the MCP markitdown service on November 15, 2025. The conversion captured:
- Full text content
- Section structure
- Author information
- References and citations
- Tables and figures (descriptions)

## Integration Status

✅ **Completed Tasks:**
1. All 5 PDFs successfully converted to markdown
2. Key information extracted and summarized in PAPERS_SUMMARY.md
3. BibTeX entries created and added to `../arxiv-paper/references.bib`
4. Integration guide created with specific LaTeX code snippets
5. Cross-reference analysis completed

## Using These Papers

### For Literature Review
- See `PAPERS_SUMMARY.md` for quick reference of key concepts from each paper
- Use the cross-paper themes section to identify common research directions

### For Integration
- Follow the step-by-step guide in `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- Each section includes exact LaTeX code to insert into paper.tex
- Citations are properly formatted and reference the correct BibTeX keys

### Citation Keys
- `miehling2025systems` - IBM Research systems theory
- `acharya2025agentic` - IEEE Access comprehensive survey
- `raheem2025agentic` - IEEE EIT trustworthiness
- `sapkota2026agents` - Information Fusion taxonomy
- `bandi2025rise` - Future Internet review

## Statistics

- **Total Papers**: 5
- **Total Pages (approximate)**: 150+
- **New References Added**: 5
- **Total Review Paper References**: 104 (was 99)
- **Key Concepts Extracted**: 50+
- **Integration Points**: 11 major sections

## Next Steps

1. Review the INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md for specific LaTeX snippets
2. Add content section by section to paper.tex
3. Compile the LaTeX document to check for errors
4. Verify all citations are correctly formatted
5. Adjust content density if page limits are a concern

## Notes

- All PDFs were converted using MCP markitdown on November 15, 2025
- The conversion maintains scientific accuracy and citation integrity
- BibTeX entries include DOI numbers where available
- Integration preserves the academic tone of the original review paper
