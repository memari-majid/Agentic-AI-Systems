# Appendix: Deep Dives and Ecosystem

This appendix provides more detailed tutorials and supplementary information for the "Advanced Agentic AI Systems" course.

## Table of Contents

-   **[Agentic AI Design with LangChain and LangGraph](Agentic_AI_Design_Tutorial.md)**: A comprehensive guide on using LangChain and LangGraph together to build sophisticated, stateful AI agents, covering core concepts, practical examples, advanced patterns, persistence, and debugging.
-   **[Introduction to DSPy: Programming over Prompting](DSPy_Introduction.md)**: An overview of DSPy, its core philosophy of separating concerns (signatures, modules, optimizers), how it complements LangChain, and its general workflow for optimizing LM-driven pipelines.
-   **[Leveraging Cloud Services for Agentic AI Systems](Cloud_Agentic_AI_Services_Tutorial.md)**: A high-level guide to using services from AWS, Azure, and GCP for hosting, orchestrating, and managing agentic AI systems, including common architectural patterns and platform-specific considerations.

*(More content may be added here as the course evolves.)*

## Contents

- [LangChain Tutorial](LangChain_Tutorial.md): A comprehensive guide to using LangChain for building agentic AI systems.
- [LangGraph Tutorial](LangGraph_Tutorial.md): A detailed guide to using LangGraph for orchestrating complex agent workflows with state management.

## Purpose

These appendix materials provide additional references, tutorials, and resources that complement the main content of the book but aren't essential to the core learning path. They're designed to help readers deepen their understanding of specific technologies and frameworks used in agentic AI development.

## How to Use

Each file in this directory can be read independently as a reference when you encounter related topics in the main book. They serve as extended resources for readers who want to explore particular subjects in more detail.
