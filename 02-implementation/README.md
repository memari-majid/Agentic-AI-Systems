## Learning Path

**Recommended Order:** Sequential (Chapters 01 → 10)

This track is designed for hands-on learning. Each chapter includes practical examples and code implementations.

## Prerequisites

- **Programming:** Python experience (intermediate level)
- **AI/ML:** Basic understanding of LLMs and APIs
- **Tools:** Familiarity with APIs and web services
- **Theory:** [Foundations](../01-foundations/) track recommended but not required

## Tools You'll Master

- **LangChain** - Agent foundation framework
- **LangGraph** - State management and orchestration
- **DSPy** - Prompt optimization and evaluation
- **LangSmith** - Debugging and monitoring
- **Python** - Primary development language

## Hands-On Practice

Complement this section with:
- **[Beginner Labs](../06-labs/)** - Start with labs 01-03
- **[Intermediate Labs](../06-labs/)** - Progress to labs 04-07
- **[Advanced Labs](../06-labs/)** - Master labs 08-13

## Next Steps

After mastering implementation:

1. **Explore Modern Tools**: [Modern Frameworks](../03-modern-frameworks/) for latest technologies (2024-2025)
2. **Deepen Understanding**: [Foundations](../01-foundations/) for theoretical depth
3. **Scale to Production**: [Strategy](../04-strategy/) for organizational deployment
4. **Stay Current**: [Research](../05-research/) for emerging developments

## Alternative Approaches

While this track focuses on LangChain/LangGraph, consider exploring:

- **[Pydantic AI](../03-modern-frameworks/pydantic-ai.md)** - Type-safe, production-ready agents
- **[OpenAI Swarm](../03-modern-frameworks/orchestration-frameworks.md)** - Lightweight multi-agent coordination
- **[Enterprise Platforms](../03-modern-frameworks/enterprise-platforms.md)** - AWS, Azure, Google solutions
