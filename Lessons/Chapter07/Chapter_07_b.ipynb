    "In this section of Chapter 7, you read about some of the concepts of environment modeling and what Static and Dynamic environments are. These concepts ultimately tie back to how you maintain agent memory throughout an agentic workflow. So let's look at examples of the three different memory types we discussed-\n",

    "- Short-term memory (working memory)\n",
    "- Long-term memory (knowledge base)\n",
    "- Episodic memory (interaction history)\n",

    "Most agentic frameworks supports some sort of memory management (for example CrewAI's [memory management](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/memory)), there are other frameworks that are solely purpose built for memory management in agentic systems, such as [LangMem](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langmem/).\n",

    "### Short-term memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use LangGraph's thread-scoped memory. This is a type of memory that lets your application remember previous interactions within a single thread or conversation. A thread organizes multiple interactions in a session, similar to the way email groups messages in a single conversation. In the following example, you will notice that we interact with the agent with two different thread_id and the agent is able to keep the memory separate for each thread rather than updating the global long-term memory.\n"

      "   - **Stay**: Consider staying in a ryokan (traditional inn) to immerse yourself in local culture. Tawaraya is a renowned option, although it might be on the higher end of your budget. For a more budget-friendly choice, try something like Hiiragiya Bekkan.\n",

      "   - **Day Trip**: From Kyoto, take a day trip to Nara, known for its historical significance and the friendly deer that roam freely.\n",

      "3. **Flights**: Depending on your departure location and destination, round-trip flights can range from $200 to $1,000+. Booking in advance or during sales can help reduce costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Food and Dining**: \n",
      "   - Street food or casual dining can be as low as $5-15 per meal.\n",
      "   - Mid-range restaurants might charge $20-50 per meal.\n",
      "   - Fine dining could be $75+ per meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Activities**: Beach activities like snorkeling, surfing lessons, or boat tours can range from $20-100 per activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Transportation**: Consider local transportation like buses, taxis, or rentals. Costs can vary based on the region.\n",

In this type, memories are stored as individual documents or records. For each new conversation, the memory system can decide to insert new memories to the store. In this case, a long-term memory is saved globally within a namespace named `travel_preferences`. Whenever we define the agentic workflow with that namespace, regardless of the thread it will refer to the globally stored preferences. This also can be useful to store information such as travel advisories, weather conditions etc. that apply globally to all travel related conversations and are perhaps not user specific."

    "Episodic memory preserves successful interactions as learning examples that guide future behavior. Unlike short-term memory which stores facts, episodic memory captures the full context of an interaction—the situation, the thought process that led to success, and why that approach worked. These memories help the agent learn from experience, adapting its responses based on what has worked before. In the following example, we create a travel agent system with episodic memory using the `langmem` library. The code defines a `TravelEpisode` schema that captures four critical elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the customer's travel request \n",
    "- the agent's planning considerations\n",
    "- the specific recommendation provided, and \n",
    "- the positive outcome that resulted. \n",
    " \n",
    "When the system processes a conversation where a traveler expresses concerns about Italian crowds, it stores how the agent successfully redirected them to less-crowded alternatives while still satisfying their desire for art and cuisine. This structured approach to remembering successful interactions allows the system to develop a repository of effective strategies that can be applied to similar situations in the future."
